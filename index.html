				<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
					<p>
						I've been in accounting for about ten years where I mostly process payables. Although this is a great career path, there isn't a lot of room for growth.

				<h3>Me...</h3>
					<p>
						Hey! I'm Natasha Nulton and I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio. I didn't always want to be a developer, however my educational path has peaked my interest in the career field. The idea of creating something out of nothing through the use of code is very fascinating to me. I also want to challenge myself and have a better paying job.

				<h4>Educational Experience</h4>
					<p>
						I hold a BS in Game Design from Full Sail University and I graduated in 2019.
						I'm continuing my education through various online methods
						to learn development. One this that I absolutely love about computer science is that you can never learn everything and the knowledge is always changing, requiring you to constantly adapt.
